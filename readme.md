# Running Tests

Monitor file changes and run unit tests automatically
`nodemon --exec 'npm test'`

# Components
* mocha unit test framework
* expect assertion framework
* supertest (for what again)
* rewire for dependency injection (seems to be a different name), insert fakes and mock dependencies

# Spies
What are spies?

Swap out a real dependency for a testing dependency
